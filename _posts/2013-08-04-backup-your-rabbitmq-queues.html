<p>
    QDB 0.4.4 has been released with support for automatically filling a QDB queue from a RabbitMQ queue. This
    makes it really easy to backup messages coming into RabbitMQ and play them back whenever you need them.

<p>
    This is an alpha release of QDB. <a href="/download">Download it</a> and try it out but don't use it in
    production just yet. It works but the API is still undergoing change.
