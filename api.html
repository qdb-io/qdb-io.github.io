<h1><a name="rest_api"></a>REST API</h1>

<p>The QDB API follows RESTful principles and you don't need any driver libraries to communicate with it. HTTP POST
does create or update, PUT does update only, DELETE deletes stuff and GET retrieves resources. All endpoints accept
JSON data and/or URL-encoded form data and most return JSON. The examples in this documentation use
<a href="http://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>, a utility for making HTTP requests from the command line.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# create or update a queue "foo" with max size of 100 gb
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo -d maxSize=100g
# do the same but using a JSON document foo.json: { "maxSize": "100g" }
$ curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo -d @foo.json
{% endhighlight %}

<p>QDB returns sizes as human readable strings using binary suffixes (1 MB = 1048576 bytes). You can get number
byte values instead by turning on borg mode:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo
{
    "id" : "foo",
    "version" : 1,
    "maxSize" : "100 GB",
    "maxPayloadSize" : "1 MB",
    "contentType" : "application/octet-stream"
}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo?borg=true
{
    ...
    "maxSize" : 107374182400,
    "maxPayloadSize" : 1048576,
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>The usual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">HTTP status codes</a> are used.
    POST requests that actually create something return 201 (created), those that just do an update return 200 (ok).
    POST and PUT requests both only update fields supplied in the request and leave others as is. A full JSON
    representation of the object is returned. Well-formed requests with validation errors return 422 (unprocessable
    entity). If a version number is supplied with a request and the version of the object currently on the server is
    different then a 409 (conflict) is returned.</p>

<p>QDB supports HTTP keep-alive so repeated calls to the server can be done using the same connection.</p>

<h2><a name="server"></a>Server Status</h2>

{% highlight bash %}
# is all well in the world of qdb?
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/status
{
    "uptime" : "15 days 8:22:04",
    "heapFreeMemory" : "10.86 MB",
    "heapMaxMemory" : "15.06 MB",
    "otherFreeMemory" : "60.01 MB",
    "otherMaxMemory" : "80 MB"
}
# use gc=true to garbage collect for more accurate free memory info
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/status?gc=true
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="queues"></a>Queues</h2>

<p>QDB queues are ring buffers with a configurable maximum size. When a queue is full the oldest messages are
efficiently deleted in chunks. QDB supports fast retrieval of messages by ID and timestamp. Queues can have
<a href="#outputs">outputs</a> which automatically send messages somewhere else (e.g. to RabbitMQ).</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# create queue "incoming" with capacity of 200 gb and max message size of 10 mb
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming -d maxSize=200g -d maxPayloadSize=10m
# the contentType of a queue is used when retrieving individual messages
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming -d contentType="application/json; charset=utf-8"
{% endhighlight %}

<h3><a name="appending"></a>Appending Messages</h3>

<p>Messages can be POSTed individually or in bulk. Each message may have an optional routing key string (max 255
characters), is timestamped and assigned a unique id. The message itself can be any binary or text data. Message id's
are not consecutive but newer messages always have bigger id's than older messages.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# append a single message with payload from message.dat (the body of the POST)
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?routingKey=abc:def -d @message.dat
{
  "id" : 44,
  "timestamp" : "2013-07-07T23:13:29.277+0200",
  "payloadSize" : 100,
  "routingKey" : "abc:def"
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>POSTing individual mentions can be quite fast (2000-3000 messages/sec on an 2011 MacBook Pro, each message 0-4k in
size) because QDB supports HTTP keep-alive. If you need more performance POST messages in batches by specifying
multiple=true.</p>

<p>QBD uses a variation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstrings">netstrings</a> to encode the
routing key and payload of message in a batch. The routing key is prefixed by its size in bytes in decimal ASCII digits
followed by a colon and the UTF8 encoded string and a linefeed (\n, ASCII 10). The payload is prefixed with its size in bytes
followed by a colon and the actual byte data and a linefeed. Extra linefeeds are ignored. Example (batch.txt):</p>

{% highlight text %}
3:one
12:Hello world!
7:one:two
26:The payload is binary data
{% endhighlight %}

<p>QDB returns an array of JSON objects, one for each message appended:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?multiple=true -d @batch.txt
[ {
  "id" : 30,
  "timestamp" : "2013-07-14T19:47:21.241+0200",
  "payloadSize" : "12 bytes",
  "routingKey" : "one"
}, {
  "id" : 60,
  "timestamp" : "2013-07-14T19:47:21.241+0200",
  "payloadSize" : "26 bytes",
  "routingKey" : "one:two"
} ]
{% endhighlight %}

<p>If there is an error then appending stops at the first failed message. The created field in the JSON error
response identifies the successfully appended messages:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl -XPOST "http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages?multiple=true" -d @batch.txt
{
  "responseCode" : 422,
  "message" : "Expected 27 bytes, only read 26 while reading payload",
  "created" : [ {
    "id" : 0,
    "timestamp" : "2013-07-14T19:45:56.743+0200",
    "payloadSize" : "12 bytes",
    "routingKey" : "one"
  } ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

<p>QDB can append 5000-6000 messages/sec, each 0-4k in size on a 2011 MBP using batches of 50.</p>

<h3><a name="retrieving"></a>Retrieving Messages</h3>

<p>Old messages can be efficiently retrieved by id or timestamp and new messages streamed as they arrive:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Dump new messages to the console until ctrl-C
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/incoming/messages
88:{"id":30,"timestamp":"2013-07-14T19:47:21.241+0200","payloadSize":12,"routingKey":"one"}
Hello world!
92:{"id":60,"timestamp":"2013-07-14T19:47:21.241+0200","payloadSize":26,"routingKey":"one:two"}
The payload is binary data
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Each messages is prefixed with a single line JSON header preceded by its size in bytes in decimal ASCII digits
(see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstrings">netstrings</a>) and a colon, followed by a linefeed
(\n, ASCII 10). The binary payload immediately follows the header and is followed by a linefeed. QDB will write extra
linefeeds every 29 seconds if there are no new messages to keep the connection alive. The Content-Type of the response
is application/octet-stream.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This endpoint supports a number of other optional parameters shown with the default values:</p>

<div class="param-table">
    <table class="table table-condensed">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>limit</td>
            <td>unlimited</td>
            <td>Stop after returning this many messages</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>noHeaders</td>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>Don't send the header JSON</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>noLengthPrefix</td>
            <td>false</td>
            <td>Don't prefix the header JSON with its length</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>timeoutMs</td>
            <td>29000</td>
            <td>Send a keep alive (linefeed) every this many milliseconds if no messages are available</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>keepAlive</td>
            <td>\n</td>
            <td>The string sent to keep the connection alive (can be multiple characters)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>separator</td>
            <td>\n</td>
            <td>The string sent immediately after each payload (can be multiple characters)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<h2><a name="outputs"></a>Outputs</h2>

<p>Outputs are attached to queues and do something with incoming or existing messages (e.g. publish them to a RabbitMQ
exchange).</p>

<h2><a name="databases"></a>Databases</h2>

<p>Queues in QDB are grouped into databases. There is a database called "default" that is assumed when
no database is specified, which is why these two calls return information about the same queue (foo):</p>

{% highlight bash %}
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/q/foo
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/db/default/q/foo
{% endhighlight %}

<h2><a name="security"></a>Security & Users</h2>

<p>QDB uses HTTP basic authentication. The QDB server creates a user called "admin" on startup with full access
to everything. The default password for the "admin" user is "admin" unless it is changed in the
<a href="#configuration">configuration file</a> or after startup using the API. If no authentication information
is supplied then admin:admin is assumed. Non-admin users can only access databases they own.</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# create an admin user "david" with password "secret"
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/users/david -d admin=true -d password=secret
# list all users
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/users
# get details of the "david" user
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:9554/users/david
# authenticate as "david" and list all database visible to "david"
$ curl --user david:secret http://127.0.0.1:9554/db
# change the password for the "admin" user
$ curl -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:9554/users/admin -d password=oink
{% endhighlight %}
